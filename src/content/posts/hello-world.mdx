## Hello, world!

My name is Robert and I am a software engineer with approximately 3 years of experience, most of which have been as a fullstack web application developer.
<br/>
This is my first blog post, and I am very happy to say that I am hoping to start a new chapter in my journey as a developer by becoming more actively involved online and sharing what knowledge I've gained so far.

## Why now?

In the first years of my career, as I was getting comfortable and establishing some basic foundations of knowledge around web development, security and other topics that came to my attention, I chose to stick to small projects (besides those at work) so that I can gain knowledge quickly, with those projects never intended for anyone other than me.
<br/>
Now that I have become more confident and have gained some practical knowledge, I want to dive deeper and use my free time to develop more meaningful projects, and hold myself accountable by sharing my progress on a more consistent basis to a wider audience.

## What to expect?

On the backend side, my framework of choice at the moment is `NestJS`. (check <a href="https://nestjs.com/" target="_blank">them</a> out, their site has a lot of cat pics üêà).

<br />

On the frontend side, I am exploring different options, and perhaps even open-sourcing this blog and documenting the process of developing it.

<br />
For now, I will be using <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rtabacaru/" target="_blank">Linkedin</a> as the main medium to share content from this blog.
<br />
Talk to you soon üëÄ.
