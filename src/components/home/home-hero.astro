      <h5>About rtcs</h5>
      <p>
        My favourite part about tech (and especially the web) is the community.
        I love exchanging ideas with peers and challenging the status quo.
        <br />
        This portfolio is my first contribution to the open-source community and
        I will use it to share the most interesting stuff I come across in my journey.
        <br />
